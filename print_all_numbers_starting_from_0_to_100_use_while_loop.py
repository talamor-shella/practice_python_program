#Prog08: Create a program that print all the odd numbers starting from 0 to 100. (Use while loop)

#set odd number variable to 1
odd_numbers = 1

#odd_number < 101
while odd_numbers < 100:

    #prints all the odd number
    print(odd_numbers)

    #use addition assignment operator
    odd_numbers += 2
